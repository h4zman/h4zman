-  Hi, I’m Hazman, 23 years old student from Malaysia who is studying Bachelor of Computer and Communication System Engineering with Honour.

-  I’m currently exploring on Robotics, using Linux as OS, Robot Operating System (ROS) as framework and Gazebo as software for my Final Year Project which is an Autonomous UV Disinfection Robot.

-  You can contact me at hazman.shahul@gmail.com for anything :)

Will update the group members, project pictures, description and details for my past project/s in the future
